#Sticker
Allows you to surf and keep tabs on your favorite stocks at the same time without additional effort (e.g. check a website or an external widget)

Configure up to 5 of your favorite stocks. Also configure the frequency in which the display and stocks should refresh. The stock information is displayed only on the active tab when you switch tabs and doesn't interfere with your browsing.  

Convenient (Omnibox) commands on the address bar-
* **sticker start** - Starts sticker from *start* or *pause* state
* **sticker stop** - Stops sticker.
* **sticker pause** - Pauses sticker. Automatically start when the browser restarts.
* **sticker options** - Opens options page
